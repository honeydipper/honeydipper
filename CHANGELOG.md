* **drivers:** needs to update the spanner native backup related system/workflows.
* **drivers:** the payload structure is slightly changed so that the three piece of information
can be fetched from the right place. The existing `reload` function in `honeydipper-config-essentials`
requires corresponding change to function. So is the slack `resume_session`.
